If you're aiming to **disable source code download** in App Engine, your goal is to prevent the platform from **storing or serving your appâ€™s source artifacts** (like ZIPs or raw files). Hereâ€™s how that connects with your Terraform setup:

### ðŸ”’ What You *Donâ€™t* Want in Terraform

Avoid configurations that **upload** source code to App Engine directlyâ€”especially these:

- **ZIP-Based Deployment:**
  ```hcl
  deployment {
    zip {
      source_url = "https://storage.googleapis.com/my-bucket/my-app.zip"
    }
  }
  ```
- **File-Based Deployment:**
  ```hcl
  deployment {
    files = {
      "main.py" = {
        source = "${path.module}/main.py"
      }
    }
  }
  ```
Both of these result in GCP **storing** your source code (e.g., in the staging bucket), which can be retrieved if permissions arenâ€™t tightly controlled.

### âœ… How to "Disable" via Terraform Practice

To keep source code **undownloadable or uninvolved**, you can:

#### 1. **Avoid Using `deployment` Block Altogether**
Don't provide source paths in your Terraform config. This tells App Engine youâ€™re not submitting code through Terraform.

#### 2. **Use Prebuilt Containers Instead**
App Engine Flexible Environment allows containerized apps. Example:
```hcl
resource "google_app_engine_standard_app_version" "custom" {
  runtime    = "custom"
  service    = "default"
  version_id = "v1"

  entrypoint = "your-custom-entrypoint"

  deployment {
    container {
      image = "gcr.io/your-project/custom-image:latest"
    }
  }
}
```
This deploys from an image, not raw codeâ€”GCP stores the container, not your files.

#### 3. **Move Code Deployment Outside of Terraform**
Use CI/CD tools or `gcloud app deploy` to push code separately. Then, treat Terraform as your **infra orchestrator**, not a delivery pipeline.

Would you like help converting a source-based deployment into a container-based one or auditing a `.tf` file for exposure risks? Iâ€™ve got ideas we can dig into.
