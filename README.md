The constraint appengine.disableCodeDownload in Google Cloud Platform is a boolean organization policy that disables the ability to download the source code of applications previously uploaded to App Engine. When this constraint is enforced (set to true), users—even those with strong privileges—cannot download the deployed source code from App Engine.


The appengine.disableCodeDownload constraint in GCP only prevents source code download through the App Engine platform interfaces and APIs (like the GCP Console, gcloud CLI, and App Engine SDK tools). It disables the capability to download deployed source code using App Engine mechanisms.

In other words, once this constraint is enforced, users cannot download the deployed source code via any official App Engine platform method regardless of their IAM roles. This ensures the source code is protected and cannot be extracted through App Engine's standard download mechanisms.
