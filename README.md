## What "Sets the internal DNS setting for new projects to Zonal DNS Only" means:

* This is an **organization-level constraint** that affects **how DNS resolution works for *all VM instances* within new projects** created under that org/folder.
* It sets the **default DNS behavior** for the *project* — specifically, whether VMs use **Zonal DNS** or the default (usually global) DNS.

### What `vmdnssetting` metadata does:

* `vmdnssetting` is a **project-level metadata key** also **instance level** that **enables or controls zonal/global DNS for all VMs in that project** or a **single vm**.

## 1. Project-level vmdnssetting
Set at the project metadata level.

Controls the default internal DNS behavior for all VM instances in the project.

This is the broad setting that influences how DNS resolution works project-wide.

Setting it here affects all existing and new VMs unless overridden at the instance level.

## 2. Instance-level vmdnssetting
Can be set on individual VM instances.

Overrides the project-level setting for that particular VM.

Useful if you want specific VMs to use different DNS behavior than the project default.



**Iam confused which is default dns for mars** 

**[default DNS type according to this which one ?](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/internal-dns#instance-fully-qualified-domain-names).**




### 1. **Default Internal DNS Type (When Compute Engine API is Enabled)**:

* When you enable the **Compute Engine API** in Google Cloud, the **default internal DNS type** is either **Global DNS** or **Zonal DNS** based on **when the API was enabled** and whether the project was created before or after a specific date (September 6, 2018).

  * **Before September 6, 2018**: The default internal DNS type is **Global DNS**.
  * **After September 6, 2018**: The default internal DNS type is **Zonal DNS**.

  This is a default **global setting** at the **project level**, which controls the DNS resolution for your VMs.

### 2. **`vmdnssetting` Metadata**:

* The **`vmdnssetting`** is a **metadata key** that can be set **at the project level** or **instance level** in Google Cloud.
* It **overrides the default DNS type** that the project inherits from the Compute Engine API settings.

  * If **`vmdnssetting` is set to "global"**, it forces the project (or VM) to use **Global DNS**.
  * If **`vmdnssetting` is set to "zonal"**, it forces the project (or VM) to use **Zonal DNS**.

### **Key Differences:**

1. **Default Internal DNS Type (Compute Engine API)**:

   * This is determined automatically when the **Compute Engine API** is first enabled.
   * If your project was created **before September 6, 2018**, the **default** is **Global DNS**.
   * If your project was created **after September 6, 2018**, the **default** is **Zonal DNS**.
   * **This is a "one-time" setting** for the project and affects all VMs unless overridden.

2. **`vmdnssetting` Metadata**:

   * This is an **override mechanism** that you can **explicitly configure**.
   * You can set **`vmdnssetting` at the project level** to enforce **Global DNS** or **Zonal DNS**, **regardless of the original default** set when the Compute Engine API was enabled.
   * You can also **set `vmdnssetting` at the instance level** to override the DNS behavior for individual VMs.

---

### **How They Work Together:**

* **If you have not changed `vmdnssetting`**, the **default DNS type** (either **Global DNS** or **Zonal DNS**) is determined by the **Compute Engine API's default**, which is based on when the API was enabled in your project.

  * **Before September 6, 2018**: The project defaults to **Global DNS**.
  * **After September 6, 2018**: The project defaults to **Zonal DNS**.
* **If you explicitly set `vmdnssetting`**:

  * This will override the default DNS type set by the **Compute Engine API**. So even if your project was created before September 6, 2018 (default Global DNS), setting `vmdnssetting` to **zonal** would force **Zonal DNS** for all VMs (or just the VMs where it's applied).

### **Example Scenarios:**

1. **Project Created Before September 6, 2018 (Default Global DNS)**:

   * If you **don’t set `vmdnssetting`**, it will use **Global DNS** by default (based on when the project was created).
   * If you **set `vmdnssetting` to "zonal"**, all VMs will use **Zonal DNS**, overriding the default global setting.

2. **Project Created After September 6, 2018 (Default Zonal DNS)**:

   * If you **don’t set `vmdnssetting`**, it will use **Zonal DNS** by default (since the project was created after the cutoff date).
   * If you **set `vmdnssetting` to "global"**, all VMs will use **Global DNS**, overriding the default zonal setting.
