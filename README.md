## Domain restricted contacts

Domain Restricted Contacts is an organization policy to restrict email domains allowed for Essential Contacts.

Only emails from approved domains (e.g., @example.com) can be added as new Essential Contacts.

This policy increases security by preventing unauthorized or external email contacts.

Checkov can be used to pre-validate Terraform code to ensure contact emails conform to this domain restriction before deployment.
